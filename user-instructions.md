## Making a gym admin

1. Create new trainer

- note: if the trainer you'd like to be an admin is already created, skip to the next step
- go to trainer page, press the "+"
- fill out all the fields
- Press Add
- The name should now appear on the trainers list
- log out, and log back in. This is kind of a hack to refresh the administrator selecter we'll use in the next step

2. Make that trainer a gym admin

- log out, log back in
- go to locations
- click on info button for specific gym
- edit
- choose trainer to be admin

1. create new dietitian

- As of 9/28/2022, this is not working correctly. Need to look into it.

2. Make an existing dietitian a dietitian office admin

- this is just like above and is working correctly
